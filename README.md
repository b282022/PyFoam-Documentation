### Installation of PyFOAM
There are many ways of installing PyFOAM depending upon your system, but we will explore only 1 way which is very easy.
Other ways of installation can be explored [here](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/PyFoam#Installation)

PyFOAM requires the latest version of pip, numpy and gnuplot

For installing pip you can write the following command in your terminal
``` sudo apt-get install python-pip ```

To install numpy via pip enter following command in your terminal 
``` sudo pip install numpy ```

If you have numpy already installed, then make sure that it is in the newest version. This can also be done using following command, if there are new versions available then it will update numpy or it will say that numpy is already in the newest version
``` sudo pip install --upgrade numpy ```

To install gnuplot, enter following command in your terminal 
``` sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11 ```

Now as all the dependencies are satisfied, we will move on to installation of PyFOAM
Install PyFOAM using pip by entering following command in your terminal
``` sudo pip install PyFoam ```

Just to make sure that PyFOAM is in newest version, type following command in your terminal
``` sudo pip install --upgrade PyFoam ```
